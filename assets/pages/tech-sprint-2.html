        <div class="title">What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</div>
        <br>
        <p>There is this idea of the Box model in html and css.<br>
          Each bit of content that you place on your webpage can be thought of as a "Box".
          Each box has three properties that can be defined. Margin, Border and Padding.
          When you create a peice of content in html for your webpage natrually you want to style and position that
          peice of content in and around the other content.
          The way to do that is to use css.

        </p>
        <img src="../img/box-model.png" class="box">
        <div class="title">The difference between margin, border and padding.</div>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          As shown in the image above the content is surrounded by these three layers, separting the content from the
          rest of the webpage.
          The border is the line between inside the element and outside, where margin is on the outside and padding is
          on the inside.
          Where the border is more of a line the margin and padding define the amount of space around that line (or
          outside and inside of the element).
          All of these can be defined in css.<br><br>

          Margin can be thought of the space between the peice of content and other surrounding content, making sure
          the peices of content touch or not.<br><br>

          Padding can be thought of the space between the border and the content its self. Without and padding the
          content
          would sit right at the edge of the border. Adding some space between these two could help with readability if
          your peice of conent is a paragraph of text for example.<br><br>

          Border as previously mentioned is the line between margin and padding.
          It ultimately defines the edge of the peice of content, and it's size and thickness can be altered in css.
