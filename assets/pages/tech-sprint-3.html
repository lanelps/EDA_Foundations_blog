                <p>The differences between HTML & CSS</p>
                <br>
                <p> HTML and CSS could be described like the human body.<br>
                    HTML is the skeletal structure of the webpage.
                    You have the the entire human as a whole with all its parts(The document and html tag).
                    You also have a <b>head</b> and a <b>body</b> and <i>sometimes</i> feet (<b>footer</b>).
                    Without HTML the webpage wouldn't have bones and wouldn't hold, there would be no webpage.<br><br>

                    CSS makes that skeletal structure look pretty with proper positioning and sizing of body parts, and
                    cosmetic colors.<br><br>
                    One can exist without the other but together they make a better team.
                </p>

                <br>
                <div class="title">Control Flow & Loops</div><br>
                <p>
                    Control flow is the order in which instructions in a program are executed.
                    The code is carried out from top to bottom, and any decisions in the code are also made, effecting
                    how the code is played out.
                    <br>
                    This could be thought out like your daily routine. You wake up in the morning. What's the next
                    thing you do?
                    Usually you have a routine you carry out in the morning. So it could be thought out like this.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Daily Routine:<br>
                    1. Wake up<br>
                    2. Have a shower<br>
                    3. Brush your teeth<br>
                    4. Choose an outfit<br>
                    5. get changed<br>
                    <br>
                    Maybe then you have a condtion that changes on a certain circumstance. Maybe instead of the weather
                    being sunny
                    it's raining instead.<br>
                    So instead of just wearing a shirt you decided to wear something warmer and a rain coat to keep off
                    the rain.
                    <br>
                    So then you could think of the control flow like this.
                    <br><br>
                    Daily Routine:<br>
                    1. Wake up<br>
                    2. Have a shower<br>
                    3. Brush your teeth<br>
                    4. Choose an outfit<br>
                    (if weather is rainy then){<br>
                    Wear rain coat<br>
                    } else if (weather is sunny){<br>
                    Wear shirt
                    }<br>
                    5. Get changed<br>
                    <br>
                    The control changes depending on the condition of the weather statement.<br>
                    If one or the other is true it will run that line of code instead of the other code, which will be
                    missed entirely.

                <div class="title">The DOM</div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The DOM or Document Object Model basically is how the browser interprets our HTML code. This can be
                    thought out in a tree graph. Starting with your Document, it has one branch which will be our HTML
                    code. From our HTML branch will have a head and body branch, then will break up each individual
                    element in the head and body into their own branches. This creates a hierarchical structure of
                    branches of nodes and objects.
                    <br><br>
                    This hierarchical structural arrangement helps the browser read the document so that it can apply
                    javascript to specified nodes and/or objects.
                    Say if you wrote some javascript to change the text inside a paragraph element that wrapped inside
                    a div. The browser would use DOM to navigated the document to find where branch the paragraph
                    element is. So it would start with the document, then look into the HTML and see there are two
                    branches, head and body, then into the body it finds a specific div and within that div, it will
                    find the paragraph that's needed to change. Now the browser knows exactly where the paragraph
                    element is it can run the code to change the current text inside that element.
                </p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <div class="title">Arrays & Objects</div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Arrays are a long collection of one type of data (string or number). Each item in that array is
                    accessed through a position. You can specify which bit of data you would like by referencing it's
                    position using a number. Starting from 0, if you wish to access a specific item in the array you
                    need to specify where in that array is with its position number.
                    <br><br>
                    Objects are similar to arrays, wherein they are a collection of data, but different types of data
                    can be stored (numbers, strings and even functions). Instead of using a number to specify a
                    particular item in the object, we use keys which are basically names for the specific bit of data.
                </p>

                <div class="title">Functions</div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Functions are a group of code that you can call upon at any time as often as you'd like. These can
                    contain either simple or very complex calculations, even other functions. Functions are handy
                    because it saves you from writing the same code for the same functions over and over again.
