        <p>1. Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</p>
        <br>
        I would say some of my core values are Open-mindedness, Good humor, Creativity, Positivity and Optimism.
        <br><br>
        <p>* Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values
          involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Stood up for that guy at dominoes who was getting yelled/ threatened by someone else.
          I saw what started the situation and how the guy threatening was in the wrong, I felt morally abliged to help
          the guy being yelled at.</p>

        <p>I stepped in to defend the guy. The guy yelling eventually left after some convincing and the other guy was
          thankful for helping, as well as some on lookers of the situation.</p>
        <br>

        <p>* Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I suppose my culture is New Zealand culture which is all relatively the same throughout the country, altough
          coming from the south island town of Wanaka,
          there are certainly some differences in terms of culture in Auckland. North island vs south island, small
          town vs big city.
          Coming from Wanaka I was surrounded by nature constantly, it certainly influences how I and my teenage
          friends behaved having
          such an open outdoor loving community such as Wanaka. We we're encourgaed to get out and adventure and how
          could we not
          in such a place. I'd say if I had my developnig years here in Auckland things were surely be different. This
          has definitely been
          a big influencer in my core values.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <p>2. Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</p>
        <br>
        My strengths I would say are that I'm natrually Curious and Observant.
        Generally energetic and but mostly always Enthusiastic.
        I think i'm an excellent communicator.
        I know how to relax and have fun in certain situations.
        <br><br>
        My limitations I would say are I find it difficult to focus, I tend to over think things.
        Poor practicle skills. I can get stressed easily but not outwardly.
        I tend to be more indepentdent when it comes to projects,
        and ideas. Putting too much of the role on mysel and not others.
        <br><br>

        <p>* Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning
          journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I think my enthusiasm and general curiosity will help me with my learning.
          These strengths usually help me get through the rough parts of learning something new.
          Keepng optimistic and keen to learn whatever challenges I am facing will always help me pull through.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>* Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others,
          but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were,
          and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          With my recent graphics course we had to create and brand identity and manage and market our end of year
          exhibition.
          We had to do this ontop of our existing projects and deadlines. This was an obviously stresful time for
          everyone.
          But I stepped up as one of the lead designers and marketers. The job needed to be done so I took charge.
          There was some resistance with some descign choices that I and others made from others in the class. The best
          strategy I found is to sit down and talk about what the issue is and work around and come to a conclusion
          that everyone
          could agree on even if it's not 100% what someone had in mind.
