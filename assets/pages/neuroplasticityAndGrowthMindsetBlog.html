                <p>1. Research Neuroplasticity</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <p>
                    - Discuss how understanding the principles of Neuroplasticity benefits people.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Understanding the idea that your brain is always changing and can be changed to form newer and
                    better habits and skills is hugely beneficial to anyone who is trying to learn something new,
                    whether that's a new skill or a way of thinking.
                </p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <p>
                    - Discuss how might engage with the principals of Neuroplasticity for your own benefit I will
                    definitely use these ideas and methods of reinforcing good habits by the act of doing.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    I can apply this to my studies and my daily fitness and health, if I just practice by doing these
                    beneficial actions my brain will absolutely change for the better.
                </p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <p>
                    - What are some of the ways to increase your Neuroplasticity
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    One way is to just physically do the thing you need to do, form good habits and not reenforcing
                    negative or bad habits. The belief/ the positive outlook that you can indeed change your brain by
                    focusing and doing the
                    right things.

                    - Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.

                <p>2. Research Growth Mindset</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <p>
                    - Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    A growth mindset is knowing that when faced with a challenge you have the ability to learn and
                    understanding that it takes time and practice to overcome. If you don't succeed at them right away
                    know that you can continue to learn and develop the skills necessary to eventually overcome those
                    challenges.
                </p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <p>
                    - In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Simply people who believe that they cannot improve have a fixed mindset and will not improve their
                    skills while people who have a growth mindset will actually improve their skills if they believe
                    they can eventually improve by working on their skills.
                </p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <p>
                    - How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    I will initiate a growth mindset every time I come across a difficult challenge or find my self
                    trying to tell myself I cannot accomplish something, try and notice that that is happening and
                    remember to keep trying.

                    3. Blend with your learning plan and strategies
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    - Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and
                    strategy.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    These findings just reenforce the idea that everyday I should work towards something in these
                    challenges and just sit down and get on with it. With the knowledge that by doing so I will
                    strengthen
                    positive habits and learning pathways and it will be inevitable that I will become better at
                    coding.
