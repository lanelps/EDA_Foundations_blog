                    Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?
                    I have learnt; <br>
                    * That I work well in a pairing program. <br>
                    * If I keep pushing the idea of a growht mindset I learn faster. <br>
                    * I am quite empathetic.
                    <br><br>

                    2. What has surprised you the most about the core learning? <br>
                    How implementing these concepts has helped me become a better learner and person. I am more aware
                    of what I am doing at any given moment. <br><br>

                    3. What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning?<br>
                    The most challenging was the reflecting itself and having to write in response to how I think went with certain tasks. <br><br>

                    4. Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations? <br>
                    Writing is not something I did much of before starting this course. I have found writing has become easier to do the more I reflect.
