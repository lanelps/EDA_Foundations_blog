          <br><br>
          <p>
          My strengths are I'm natrually Curious and Observant.
          Generally energetic and Enthusiastic.
          An excellent communicator.
          Know how to relax and have fun.
          <br><br>
          My limitations are I find it difficult to focus, I tend to over think things.
          Poor practicle skills. Can get stressed easily.
          More indepentdently focused when it comes to projects,
          and ideas. Putting too much of the role on mysel and not others.<br><br>

          * Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage
          your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation
          of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with
          other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.<br><br>

          I will be commited and soley focused each and everyday to complete these tasks.
          I will do this by getting up earlier and going to sleep earier. Make sure I am getting enough sleep
          and also making sure I get out and exercise everyday as well. I shouldn't be cooped up inside who the whole week,
          but make sure that there is a good balance of working and leisure. I should aim to do around 8 total hours of work,
          research and eperience. Applying these goal to working with others and facilitators will help things go smoothly.
          I should also aim to communicate with others if I am having any trouble. I should reach out, otherwise I may fall behind.
          <br>
          <br>

          * A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.<br><br>
          Each week Monday at around midday, I will meet up with Joseph and tell him abouts my concerns or issues I'm having with any of he learning.
          Else I will look to the slack channel as theyre is plenty of help there.<br><br>

          * A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.<br><br>
          I just expect them to be thorough in what they expect of us each week in terms of work, and
          how to communicate to them any struggles I might have.
