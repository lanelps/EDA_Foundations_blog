                <br>
                <p>
                    The problem was I had to capitalize each letter of each word in an array.
                    I felt quite confused as to go about the issue.
                    I broke the problem down into steps writing out psuedocode.
                    Then I could ask the right questions for each step that I was facing.
                    Then I looked around the web for additional info.
                    and eventually managed to solve the the problem.

                <div class="title">2. Solved a problem in an elegant way.</div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The problem was where I had to look through an array and if the person hiding was Scooby then say what door he was behind.
                    Almost immediatley in my head I could work out what to do.
                    But I still wrote out the steps to sort through the problem just so I was clear with myself.
                    I had to loop through the array check each object in that array's hiding property and if that property was equal to the string of Scooby then it should return that same objects door number.
                    Then the function had to break, but if it wasn't scooby then it would keep on looping till it found the hiding property with the value of scooby.

                        <p>
                            Pseudocode: <br>
                            I feel very confident using this method. It seems to help me the most, in terms of breaking down a problem into it's individual steps.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Trying something: <br>
                            I always almost do this first to see if I really grasp the problem. If not I use another probem solving technique.

                            Rubber ducky method: <br>
                            I usually talk to myself rather than an object but I feel a little confident doing this.
                        </p>

                            Reading error messages: <br>
                            I find these somewhat usefull, and usually I feel confident reading them. Depends on the diffuclty of the problem.

                            Console.logging: <br>
                            I actually quite like using concole.log to give me an idea of what some variable or object might look like after a certain step.

                            Googling: <br>
                            Propably the top of my list with this, there is so much stuff that other people have already faced that you can google.

                            Asking your peers for help: <br>
                            Not so confident in this one yet, although it is only now that I have really considered doing this as the challeges go on and get harder.
                        </p>

                            Asking coaches for help: <br>
                            This falls under the same as asking my peers, basically just asking the slack cahnnel. Not super confident about but also will actually consider asking there if I'm really stuck.

                            Improving your process with reflection: <br>
                            This is something I have not really done before/ couldn't be bothered doing before, but I think it has had great impact. It's really helped me vocalise the thoughts in my head, and also made me
                            really think back on the challenges I've faced.
