                <p>
                    The problem was I had to capitalize each letter of each word in an array.
                    I felt quite confused as to go about the issue.
                    I broke the problem down into steps writing out psuedocode.
                    Then I could ask the right questions for each step that I was facing.
                    Then I looked around the web for additional info.
                    and eventually managed to solve the the problem.

                <div class="title">2. Solved a problem in an elegant way.</div>
                <p>
                    The problem was where I had to look through an array and if the person hiding was Scooby then say what door he was behind.
                    Almost immediatley in my head I could work out what to do.
                    But I still wrote out the steps to sort through the problem just so I was clear with myself.
                    I had to loop through the array check each object in that array's hiding property and if that property was equal to the string of Scooby then it should return that same objects door number.
                    Then the function had to break, but if it wasn't scooby then it would keep on looping till it found the hiding property with the value of scooby.
